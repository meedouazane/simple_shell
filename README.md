# simple_shell
The Simple Shell project is a collaborative effort that involves building a basic command-line shell similar to the Linux shell (bash). The shell will provide a user-friendly interface for executing commands, handling basic features like executing programs, managing processes, and handling user input.

1 - Shell Functionality: Develop a simple command-line shell that reads and executes commands entered by the user.

2 - Command Execution: Implement the capability to execute commands provided by the user, including built-in commands and external programs.

3 - Built-in Commands: Incorporate essential built-in commands such as cd (change directory) and exit (terminate the shell).

Collaboration:
Divide the tasks between the two team members, allowing for parallel development. One member can focus on parsing user input, command execution, and process management, while the other can work on built-in commands, input/output redirection, and signal handling.
